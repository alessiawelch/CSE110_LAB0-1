# CSE110_LAB0-1

## Alessia's Lab 0 & 1 Turn In

- For the Command Line part of my lab look at the `add-read-me` branch and screenshots folder (in `main` branch) - the file named `screenshot_cmd.png`

- For the VS code portion, .gitignore, index.md (and basically everything else) is in the `add-fave-lang` branch. The necessary committ screenshot is in screenshots folder in the `main` branch, and it is named `screenshot_vscode.png`.
