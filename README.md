## Alessia's Lab 0 & 1 Turn In

- For the Command Line part of my lab look at the `add-read-me` branch and screenshots folder (in `main` branch)

- For the VS code portion, .gitignore, index.md (and basically everything else) is in the `add-fave-lang` branch. The necessary committ screenshot is in screenshots folder in the `main` branch.
