## My Face :)
Here is my high school senior portrait:

## Get to Know Me
Hey! My name is Alessia Welch, and I am a second Computer Science major. I am taking CSE 110, CSE 101, CSE 103, and VIS 20. I'm invovled in **Moot Court** and **Associated Students** as a **Seventh College Senator**. I also tutor for Professor Cao as a **CSE 11 Tutor**, and I am a Lead Peer Mentor for **CSE-PACE**.

If I could choose three words to describe me, It would be:
- approachable
- charismatic
- determined

## Randomness

When I told a girl I was a CS major, she told me that I could * *speak* * to computers and they could * *speak* * to me. So now, my favorite quote is:

> Computers talk to us

I told her we all have to start somewhere and showed her my first ever code I wrote in sophomore year of high school. My Hello World!

```
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

Since my first project, I have improved a lot, and most of it is documented on my [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/alessiawelch). (Feel free to give feedback or connect :))

I also had time to expirement with different coding languages. I change my mind everyday, but my current favorites are these:
1. C++ (crazy lol - tutored 100 over the summer)
2. Python (so simple but sometimes **TOO** simple)
3. Java (honestly could be higher in this list - I'm indecisive)

My goals for this year are:
[ ] push myself outside my comfort zone
[ ] get an internship :)
[ ] strengthen my friendships and relationships
